# DISCLAIMER
These scripts are AI-generated, and I do not intend to take any credit for authoring them.

# Instructions
- Install the TamperMonkey extension for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).
- Create a new script in TamperMonkey, one for each desired class (user, playlist, artist, album).
- Replace the default script with the corresponding script from the repository.
- Update the IDs in the list as per your needs.
- Save and reload Spotify Web. Make sure the script is enabled in the extension settings.

# Notes
- This only works in your browser, not on mobile or desktop apps.
- It doesn’t prevent interactions — it just visually hides unwanted users.
- If Spotify’s UI structure changes, the script may need updates.

# Side Effect
These scripts currently hide **all** content from a list containing any of the specified items. I will be accepting pull requests that modify the code to hide only the specified items from said lists.
